    January can be quite a pleasant month in central Portugal. It is not dull and rainy as the preceding months have been, nor is it as cold 
	as February. There are many bright clear days. As for the countryside, it is unremarkable. The deciduous trees have  lost (or 
	are still losing) their leaves, but there are so many evergreens that the forests don&rsquo;t look bare. Because it has been 
	raining, grasses and weeds grow, so the ground is not bare either. But there is little colour, and very few plants are flowering. 
	In our garden, we begin to see the birds coming to the bird table. The sparrows are always around, but at this season the robins, 
	chaffinches and greenfinches become visible. </p>

    <h3>Oxalis pes-caprae</h3>
    <h5> (Bermuda buttercup)</h5>

	<p><span class="latin">Oxalis pes-caprae</span> is a herbaceous weed, forming conspicuous patches of bright green leaves, above 
	which stand long-stalked heads of striking yellow flowers. Flowering in winter, it provides colour which 
	is otherwise in short supply. The flowers and leaves fold down at night, and then spread out again in the 
	day. It is most often seen along roadsides and on waste ground, and sometimes in grassland or olive orchards. 
	Though it sets seed elsewhere in the world, in Europe it propagates itself only vegetatively, by small bulbs 
	formed underground. After flowering, the above-ground plant disappears altogether for the hotter, drier part 
	of the year. The bulbs are easily spread along roads and paths.</p>
	
	<p>This plant is very characteristic of mild moist areas in Portugal not too far from the ocean. But it is 
	not native to Portugal. It comes from South Africa, and has been introduced into most of the warmer parts of 
	the world. Indeed, it is generally considered to be highly invasive, and also potentially harmful to 
	livestock. In Portugal, however, it seems to be a relatively harmless weed, remaining confined to disturbed ground.	</p>
	<p>All above-ground parts of the plant contain oxalic acid (named after the plant genus Oxalis), giving a sour 
	acid taste as in docks, sorrels and rhubarb. The only native Oxalis in Europe (Oxalis acetosella) is known as 
	wood-sorrel, but there is no general English name for Oxalis species. O. pes-caprae is known as Bermuda 
	buttercup, presumably because it was introduced there very early, but Americans call it sourgrass. Its Latin 
	name refers to �goat�'s foot�, because each of the leaflets of the clover-like leaves is divided into two oval 
	lobes whose outline resembles a goat'�s foot print. In Portuguese, as in some other languages, it is referred to 
	as a �trefoil�, &quot;trevo&quot;, because of the clover-like leaves. </p>

<h3>Ulex jussieui</h3> <h5>(gorse) </h5>

    Gorse (Ulex spp.) is all over the place in Portugal, and lives up to its reputation of having some plants in 
	flower at all times of year. The common gorse (<span class="latin">Ulex europaeus</span>) does occur around here, and mainly flowers later 
	than January. What we see now is a local endemic, <span class="latin">Ulex jussiaei</span>, with quite large flowers mostly in long spikes and a low growing habit. 
	It is common in the forests and mainly seen along roadsides. There are in fact some eight Ulex spp. which are 
	endemic to Portugal or the western part of the Iberian peninsula. They are rather similar and difficult to 
	distinguish without close examination, but their flowering periods are slightly different. The Portuguese name for this gorse is
 	tojo-dur&aacute;zio, stiff gorse. <br>
